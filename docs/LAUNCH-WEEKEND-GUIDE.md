# SUNDAY - Build in Public Day

## Mindset
You're not launching. You're sharing your journey. No pressure, no CTAs, just authentic "look what I'm making" energy.

## Post 1: Morning/Afternoon (whenever you start working)

**Theme:** Set the scene, show what you're building

```
Building a multiplayer flight sim over San Francisco this weekend

Using Google's 3D tiles - it's photorealistic

[video: 15-20 sec flying through SF, showing the detail]
```

or

```
Working on something fun

What if you could fly over SF with strangers in your browser?

[video: multiplayer planes flying around]
```

**Tips:**
- Keep it casual, exploratory
- Video/GIF is essential (this is visual)
- Don't include a link yet
- No hashtags needed

---

## Post 2: Afternoon (when you ship something)

**Theme:** Show active development, the "just shipped" moment

Pick ONE of these based on what you're working on:

### Option A: Checkpoint Racing
```
Added checkpoint racing

Golden Gate Bridge → Alcatraz → Coit Tower

Your time gets tracked and you can share it

[video: flying through checkpoints, timer visible]
```

### Option B: The Tech/AI Angle
```
Wild how fast you can build stuff now

This whole flight sim is Claude + Cursor

The 3D tiles are Google's photogrammetry of actual SF

[screenshot or video]
```

### Option C: Multiplayer Chaos
```
Multiplayer is working

This is 6 planes trying to fly through the Golden Gate at once

[video of chaos]
```

### Option D: A Challenge/Struggle
```
Trying to get the share screenshot to look good

The overlay compositing is trickier than expected

[screenshot of your work-in-progress]
```

**Tips:**
- Be specific (Golden Gate, not "landmarks")
- Show don't tell
- Struggles are relatable and engaging

## Post 3: Evening (optional, only if you have something good)

**Theme:** Reflection or cool moment

```
Can't stop flying around my own game

There's something meditative about it

[chill video flying over the bay at sunset if you have lighting]
```

or

```
The Bay Bridge at night in this thing 👀

[screenshot/video if you have night mode]
```

**Tips:**
- Don't force it - only post if genuine
- Evening posts can be more personal/reflective
- This one is optional

## Sunday Engagement Rules

1. **Reply to everyone** who comments
2. **Like tweets** from people in your niche (gamedev, indie hackers, AI builders)

# MONDAY - Anticipation Day

## Mindset

**Theme:** Progress update, momentum

```
Day 2 of building this SF flight sim

Added:

- [other feature]

## Post 2: Afternoon/Evening (3-6 PM PT)

**Theme:** The tease

```

[GIF: the money shot - your most impressive visual]
```

or more casual:

```
Ok I think it's ready

Launching tomorrow morning

[video]
```

**Tips:**
