# FlySF Launch Day Strategy
## Viral Twitter/X Playbook Based on Levelsio & Indie Hacker Best Practices

---

## Executive Summary

Based on research into Levelsio's fly.pieter.com launch (which went from $0 to $1M ARR in 17 days with 320K players) and viral indie game marketing best practices, here's your complete launch day strategy.

**Key Insight from Levelsio**: He did NOT use threads. He posted **separate, standalone tweets** with updates throughout the day/week. Each tweet was its own viral opportunity. He quote-tweeted sparingly, mainly to amplify others talking about his game.

---

## The Levelsio Pattern (What Actually Worked)

### His Posting Structure:
1. **Initial Launch Tweet** - Simple, casual, with video/GIF showing the game
2. **Separate Update Tweets** - NOT a thread, each was standalone with fresh stats/features
3. **Revenue/Stats Updates** - Posted openly with exact numbers
4. **Feature Response Tweets** - "Someone suggested X, so I added it"
5. **Milestone Celebration Tweets** - "Just hit 10K players!" with screenshot

### What He Did NOT Do:
- ❌ Long threads explaining how he built it (at launch)
- ❌ Quote-tweeting his own posts repeatedly
- ❌ Over-explaining or being promotional
- ❌ Posting too frequently (burnout/spam)

## Your Launch Day Timeline

### Pre-Launch (Night Before)
- [ ] Pin your best "teaser" tweet or video to your profile
- [ ] Ensure game is stable, can handle traffic
- [ ] Prepare 3-4 screenshot/video assets ready to post
- [ ] Draft your launch tweet (but don't overthink it)

---

### LAUNCH TWEET (9-10 AM PT / 12-1 PM ET)

**Why this time?** Peak Twitter engagement is 9 AM - 3 PM weekdays. Tuesday-Thursday are best. The algorithm heavily favors early engagement, so launching during peak hours maximizes initial momentum.

**Format:** Single tweet, NOT a thread. Keep it casual and authentic.

**Levelsio's actual launch tweet:**
> "Ok it's done, you can play it at ✈️ [link]
> I've never ever made a game before and just made my own flight simulator 100% with Cursor in I'd say 3 hours by just telling it what I wanted
> It didn't go 100% smooth ofc, but 80% yes..."

**Key elements:**
- ✅ Casual tone ("Ok it's done")
- ✅ The "AI built this" narrative hook
- ✅ Humble admission ("never made a game before")
- ✅ Specific detail ("3 hours")
- ✅ Honest ("didn't go 100% smooth")
- ✅ Video/GIF showing gameplay
- ✅ Direct link to play

**Your Launch Tweet Template:**
```
✈️ Made a multiplayer flight sim over San Francisco

Built it with Claude/Cursor - fly through actual Google 3D tiles of SF with other people

Race through checkpoints around the Golden Gate Bridge and share your times

[LINK]

[VIDEO/GIF - 10-15 seconds of gameplay]
```

**Alternative angles to test:**
- "What if you could fly over your actual city in a browser?"
- "I let AI build me a flight simulator. Here's what happened."
- "Flying through photorealistic San Francisco with strangers online"

### +2-3 HOURS: First Update (12-1 PM PT)

**Only post this IF your launch tweet is getting traction.** If it's dead, posting more won't help—focus on engaging with anyone who did respond.

**Format:** Standalone tweet (NOT quote-tweet of your launch)

**Content options:**
1. **Player count milestone:**
   ```
   Wild - 500 people are flying around SF right now 🛫

   Wasn't expecting this

   [screenshot of player count or multiplayer chaos]
   ```

2. **Someone doing something cool:**
   ```
   Someone just found you can fly under the Golden Gate Bridge

   [video clip]
   ```

3. **Feature tease:**
   ```
   Adding racing checkpoints based on the replies...

   First route: Golden Gate → Alcatraz → Coit Tower

   Times will be shareable 👀
   ```

---

### +5-6 HOURS: Afternoon Update (3-4 PM PT)

**Format:** Standalone tweet with stats/social proof

**Content:**
```
📊 6 hours since launch:

- X players have flown
- X currently online
- Someone flew for 47 minutes straight
- The Golden Gate is getting crowded

[screenshot]
```

**OR respond to a suggestion publicly:**
```
@[user] asked for [feature]

Just shipped it

[gif of feature]
```

This "I listen and ship fast" narrative is POWERFUL. Levelsio did this constantly—someone suggested a tank, he added it same day and posted about it.

---

### +8-10 HOURS: Evening Reflection (6-8 PM PT)

**Format:** More personal/reflective standalone tweet

**Content:**
```
Can't believe today.

Woke up with a flight sim prototype.
Now X thousand people have flown over San Francisco.

The AI-assisted dev thing is real.

Tomorrow: adding [feature]
```

**Why this works:** People love the "indie underdog" narrative. Showing genuine surprise/gratitude performs well.

---

## Day 2 and Beyond

### The Momentum Loop

Levelsio posted **daily updates** for about 2 weeks, each as a standalone tweet:

1. **Stats updates** (player counts, revenue if monetized)
2. **New features shipped** (based on community suggestions)
3. **Fun moments** (videos of multiplayer chaos, funny bugs)
4. **Milestone celebrations** ($X revenue, Y players, Z feature)

**Frequency:** 2-3 tweets per day MAX. Quality over quantity.

### When to Quote-Tweet Your Own Post

**DO quote-tweet when:**
- Sharing a major milestone (24hr, 48hr stats)
- Someone famous interacts with it
- Adding crucial context/update

**DON'T quote-tweet:**
- Just to bump visibility (looks desperate)
- Multiple times per day
- If the original is underperforming

### When to Use Threads

**Use a thread (later, not launch day) for:**
- "How I built this" technical breakdown
- "Lessons learned" reflection post
- Feature deep-dive

**Thread best practices:**
- Hook in first tweet
- Each tweet should work standalone
- Don't make it too long (5-10 tweets max)
- Post threads in the morning for best reach

## The "Build in Public" Updates That Work

### High-Performing Update Types:

1. **Revenue transparency** (if applicable)
   ```
   Day 3 revenue update:
   - X premium planes sold
   - Y ad impressions
   - Total: $Z

   Still can't believe this is real
   ```

2. **"Just shipped" updates**
   ```
   Someone asked for night mode

   Done ✅

   [screenshot]
   ```

3. **Community moments**
   ```
   A group of 12 players just did a synchronized flyover of Alcatraz

   I didn't build this for that but I'm here for it

   [video]
   ```

4. **Behind the scenes**
   ```
   The server just handled 500 concurrent connections

   Three.js + WebSockets doing work

   [graph/screenshot]
   ```

5. **Struggle/recovery stories**
   ```
   Site went down for 20 min

   Fixed it. We're back.

   Lost maybe 200 players but gained a lesson about WebSocket connection limits
   ```

## Engagement Strategy

### During Launch Day:

1. **Reply to EVERYONE** who comments positively
   - Short, genuine replies
   - Like their comment too
   - This signals engagement to the algorithm

2. **Don't argue** with critics
   - Thank them for feedback or ignore
   - Arguing kills momentum

3. **Amplify others talking about you**
   - Retweet/quote-tweet people playing your game
   - "Love seeing this!" type responses
   - This encourages more people to post

### The Elon Factor

Levelsio's game exploded partly because Elon Musk retweeted it saying "Wow, this is cool. AI gaming will be massive."

**You can't manufacture this, but you can:**
- Tag relevant people who might genuinely enjoy it
- Make it easy for influential people to discover (gaming hashtags, AI hashtags)
- Have a clearly shareable tweet that others would want to RT

**Do NOT:** Spam influencers. One organic tag in a thread or as a genuine question is fine. Multiple tags = desperation.

---

## Hashtags & Discovery

### For Launch Tweet:
Minimal hashtags in the main tweet (looks spammy). If using any:
- #buildinpublic
- #indiedev

### For Follow-up tweets:
Can use more discovery hashtags:
- #gamedev
- #indiegame
- #flightsim
- #threejs
- #webdev
- #AI

### Gaming-Specific:
- #screenshotsaturday (if launching Saturday)
- Post GIFs that showcase visuals

---

## What NOT To Do

### Launch Day Don'ts:

1. ❌ **Don't post a thread as your launch**
   - Single tweet performs better
   - Save threads for later breakdowns

2. ❌ **Don't over-explain**
   - Let the game speak for itself
   - Curiosity > information

3. ❌ **Don't post too frequently**
   - 3-4 posts max on launch day
   - Spamming kills reach per-tweet

4. ❌ **Don't be overly promotional**
   - "Check out my amazing game!" = cringe
   - "Made a thing, kinda wild" = authentic

5. ❌ **Don't ignore replies**
   - Engagement begets engagement
   - Algorithm rewards conversations

6. ❌ **Don't delete underperforming tweets**
   - Looks bad, doesn't help
   - Just let them sit

## The "How I Built This" Thread (Post-Launch)

Do this 2-3 days AFTER launch, once you have traction.

**Structure:**
```
Tweet 1: Hook
"I built a multiplayer flight sim in [X] hours using AI. Here's exactly how:"

Tweet 2-3: The "why"
Why you started, what inspired you

Tweet 4-6: Technical breakdown
Tools used, key decisions, what worked

Tweet 7-8: Challenges
What went wrong, how you fixed it

Tweet 9: Results
Stats, player feedback, surprises

Tweet 10: What's next + CTA
"Try it: [link]"
```

---

## Metrics to Track

### During Launch Day:
- Impressions per tweet
- Engagement rate (likes + replies + RTs / impressions)
- Click-through rate to your game
- Concurrent players (mention in updates!)

### Signs It's Working:
- Replies from strangers (not just followers)
- Quote-tweets from others
- Follower growth
- External coverage (HN, Reddit, blogs)

### Signs It's Not Working:
- < 1% engagement rate
- No replies from non-followers
- Impressions plateau quickly

**If not working:** Don't panic. Engage with whoever DID respond. Try a different angle tomorrow. Levelsio's success came from consistent shipping + updates, not just the launch tweet.
